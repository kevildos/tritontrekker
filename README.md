An Android application that lets users create markers around the campus of UC San Diego and share them with other users of the application.

* The application uses the Google Maps API to have a map of the campus already displayed. 
### Adding Points of Interest
* You can long click on any point on the map, then select `Add Location` on the side drawer in order to create a point of interest for others to see that are using the app.
* You can also make a location a `Favorite`, which allows you to save locations you like. These favorites are not viewable by other users.
* You can "like" or "dislike" Points of Interests as well in order to help let the community know what kinds of locations are accurate to their description.
* In the `Filter` tab in the menu you can select which types of Points of Interst you would like to view. Currently supported are "Restrooms", "Water Fountains", "Printers", "Trash Cans", and "Miscelleneous".
### Firebase Authentication
* Allows users to login to their personalized acounts along with displaying their own "Favorite Locations"
* Allows you to add Points of Interest and delete the Points of Interest that you created.
* Allows you to sign up with a UCSD email account. Otherwise you can use the "Guest" features which allows you to view Points of Interest across the map.

## Quick Start
If you want to run the development build, clone the Github repository in Android Studio, set up an Android phone(Minimum API 21: Android 5.0) or an emulator, and run the app. You will need a gmail email account that is registered under the UCSD domain (@ucsd.edu) to be able to sign up. Otherwise, you are able to use the Guest features of the app and can only view Points of Interest.
